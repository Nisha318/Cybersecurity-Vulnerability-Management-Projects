<h1>Cybersecurity Vulnerability Management Project with OpenVAS</h1>

<h3> This repository is dedicated to tracking my practice with Vulnerability Management tools, such as OpenVAS.  </h3>

<ul>  
  <li> Set up a secure Azure network with an OpenVAS Vulnerability Management Scanner VM </li>
  <li> Developed a vulnerable Windows 10 VM, featuring outdated software and disabled security controls </li>
  <li> Performed unauthenticated and credentialed vulnerability scans using OpenVAS </li>
  <li> Analyzed scan results, highlighting the difference between unauthenticated and credentialed scans </li>
  <li> Remediated identified vulnerabilities, verified successful remediation through subsequent scans </li>
  <li> Created a list of remediable vulnerabilities to simulate realistic vulnerability remediation scenarios </li>
</ul>
