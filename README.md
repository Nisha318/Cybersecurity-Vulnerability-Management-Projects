<h1>Cybersecurity Vulnerability Management Project with OpenVAS</h1>


<ol>  
  <li> Set up a secure Azure network with an OpenVAS Vulnerability Management Scanner VM </li>
  <li> Deploy a vulnerable Windows 10 VM, featuring outdated software and disabled security controls </li>
  <li> Execute unauthenticated and credentialed vulnerability scans using OpenVAS </li>
  <li> Analyze scan results, highlighting the difference between unauthenticated and credentialed scans </li>
  <li> Remediate identified vulnerabilities, verified successful remediation through subsequent scans </li>
  <li> Create a list of remediable vulnerabilities to simulate realistic vulnerability remediation scenarios </li>
</ol>
